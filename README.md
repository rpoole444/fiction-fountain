## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

  Fiction Fountain is an application that allows a user to generate a bedtime of story-time Story based on a prompt directed to the Openai Chatbot, additionally users are able to generated a picture!  On load you can choose to generate a story or a picture, and then you are taken to a page with an input where you can add a prompt for the bot to generate a story.  Upon submition of the prompt you are taken to a screen to view the generated story or image.

  The app incorporates a responsive layout and will change its structure to fit both large and mobile displays. It was built using functional React Hooks, Typescript, controlled form pattern, React Router. 

  In the Future I plan to add authentication to the app as well as features to save stories/images/combinations, add the feature option to generate an image and story in one prompt submition.
  
This Is my personal project and plan to continue to develop it!

I hope you have fun using Fiction Fountain!
